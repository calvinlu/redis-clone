"""Package containing Redis command implementations and dispatcher.

This package contains modules that implement various Redis commands. Each command is
implemented as a class that inherits from the base Command class and implements
the execute method.

Key Components:
    - Command: Base class for all Redis commands
    - CommandDispatcher: Handles command registration and execution
    - Individual command implementations (echo, ping, set, get, etc.)
